## Nekhbet Language Specification. Version 0.1 (*draft*)

## Types

Nekhbet uses postfix type notation. For example:

* Variable declaration

```
my_bool : bool;
```

* Function declaration

```
func my_func(arg1 : int32) : bool 
{
	...
}
```

Nekhbet defines the following categories of object (value or reference) types:

* Value types
    * Primitive types - Types intrinsic to the language. Primitives cannot have members and cannot participate in
      inheritance or be declared as `dynamic`.
    * Structure "class" types - Types made from primitives and other class types. Class types can have both value and
      function members, can participate in inheritance and be declared as `dynamic`.
    * Array types - Fixed size sequences of objects of the same type. Array types are declared by specifying the element
      type and the array extent inside of square braces (ex: `int32[8]`). Heap-allocated arrays can have dynamic extent
      specified as an expression.
* Reference types
    * Owning references - Object references that allow for automatic resource management. To declare a reference that
      does participate in GC (owning reference), the referenced type must be specified followed by `$` (ex: `int32 $`
      , `int32[8] $`). Owning references cannot reference a non-heap objects (static or stack objects), and can only be
      assigned from other owning references or be initialized via the `new` keyword (
      ex: `my_int : int32 $ = new int32(2);`). There is no constraints on the underlying implementation of owning
      references, however it is required that the referenced object is destroyed once the last managed reference to it
      is invalidated (exits scope or is re-assigned).
    * Non-owning references - References to object without automatic resource management. Such references are declared
      by using `&` after the referenced type (ex: `int32 &`). Non-owning references inherit the scope of the object they
      were assigned from (for example, reference initialized from a stack local may not exit the local's scope).
      Non-owning references may reference heap-allocated objects, by initializing the reference with the `new` operator
      and manually destroyed via the `delete` operator (ex: `my_int : int32 & = new int32;`, `delete my_int;`). Once an
      object is deleted, all references to it are invalidated. Owning references can be used to interface with native
      code.
    * Dynamic array references - Normally, references to array types include array's extent. This means, however, that
      such references may only be assigned from arrays of the same size. In order to be able to use arrays of arbitrary
      size (for example, heap-allocated arrays with extent defined by a non-constant expression), such references must
      omit the extent (leave square braces empty) during type declaration (ex: `my_arr : int32[]$ = new int32[n];`).
      Such references may be indexed like an array, however no bounds checking is preformed. Note that array types with
      dynamic extent may only be referenced, no value instances of such types may exist (creating an instance
      of `int32[]` will cause an error, while creating an instance of `int32[]$` will not).
    * Nullable "optional" references - Both non-owning and owning references can not have value of `null`. To declare a
      reference as nullable, `?` must prefix the reference (ex: `int32 ?&`, `int32[80] ?$` ). Using `?` will ensure that
      the reference can be set to `null` and be default-constructed.
    * Function "delegate" references - Delegates can be used to assign both "free" functions and lambdas. Delegates are
      declared by using the `delegate` keyword followed by its signature (ex: `my_func : delegate int32(bool)`).
      Internally, a delegate is equivalent to a pointer that either points to the target free function, or to a
      heap-allocated capturing lambda (non-capturing lambdas are equivalent to a free function). A delegate signature
      consists of the return type, followed by any amount of argument types enclosed in parentheses.

### Type Qualifiers

Nekhbet defines the following type qualifiers:

* `const` - Const qualifier can apply to object types and member function declarations. Objects of const-qualified value
  types cannot be modified after initialization. References to const-qualified types can reference a non-const object,
  however a non-const reference may not reference a const object. Const member functions can be invoked on
  const-qualified instances of their enclosing type (while non-const member functions can not).

Any qualifiers must be placed after the type in question. For example, `int32 &const` is a non-owning constant reference
to `int32` while `int32 const &` is a non-owning reference to constant of `int32` type.

### Builtin Types

Builtin types are provided by the language. Nekhbet defines the following builtin types.

#### Void type

`void` is a special type used to denote lack of a type. It cannot be instantiated (and thus can not be qualified) or
referenced. A function may return `void`, in which case there is no return value.

### User-defined Types (classes)

User can define their own structural types. This is done by the use of `class` keyword in the following way:

```
[dynamic] class <type name> [inherits <type name>[, <type name>]...]
{
	[[constructor]|[destructor]|[function member]|[object member]]...
}
```

By default, class members are private, unless explicitly declared as `public` or `protected`. Public members are
accessible from any outer scope, protected members are only accessible from the scope of class children and private
members are only accessible from within the class and it's member scopes.

Function members can be declared as `virtual`. Classes that contain any number of virtual functions are considered
virtual classes. Virtual classes carry an implicit reference to their vtable, which is used for virtual call dispatch.
All children of a virtual class are implicitly made virtual.

A class may be declared to be `dynamic`. Dynamic classes carry an implicit reference to their type, which can be used to
obtain the "real" type of a reference. References to such classes are also allowed to be down-casted. All children of a
dynamic class are implicitly made dynamic (see type casting & info section).

Note that if a class is virtual and/or dynamic, it may not be used for to call a native function, since they do not have
a "native" layout.

### Type Casting & Type Info

Type casting is done via the use of the `as` operator followed by the target type-expression (
ex: `my_int : int32 = my_float as int32`, `my_bool : bool = my_int8 as (typeof false)`).

Casts of value types are only allowed between types with defined casts. Such type casts are either built into the
language (such as casts between primitives) or may be provided via overload of the `as` operator.

Reference types are only allowed to be cast between references of related (via inheritance) types. Normally, a type
reference may only be cast to its parent type, however, if the type is declared as `dynamic` (instances of such types
contain a reference to their type info, ex: `dynamic class my_type inherits ... { ... }`), such type may be down-casted.

In order to extract type of the referenced object from its reference, the `referenced_type` member function of
the `type` type must be invoked. The default overload of this function takes no arguments and returns the direct type of
the referenced object (for example, `typeof(int32 &).referenced_type()` is equivalent to `typeof(int32)`). References
to `dynamic` types can deduce the actual type of the referenced object, in that case the reference must be passed
to `referenced_type`. Calling `referenced_type` with a reference argument on a non-dynamic type, is equivalent to the
default overload.

Objects of `type` type can only be initialized from a type-expression or be copied from another `type` object.
Default-initialization of a `type` object is equivalent to initializing it with the `void` type.

### Type-expressions

When a type is required (for example, for variable declaration), it is specified as a type-expression. Type-expressions
can have one of the following formats:

* Type identifier - Exact (possibly qualified) name of the type (ex: `int32`, `string const`).
* `typeof` keyword expression - A `typeof` expression can be used to obtain the type of it's subexpression. `typeof`
  must be followed by an expression (either a value-expression or another type-expression), and will evaluate to a type
  of that expression. In case a type-expression is specified, `typeof` will have no effect (will evaluate to the type of
  that type-expression without any change).

## Object Lifetime, Storage & Initialization.

An object's storage duration is defined by its lifetime category. Lifetime categories are separated into three major
categories (global, external & local). References and capturing lambdas inherit the lifetime category of the objects
assigned to them (or captured, in the case of lambdas). Nekhbet defines the following lifetime categories:

* Global lifetime - Lifetime of objects whose storage duration is not bound to a specific scope.
    * Static lifetime - Variables declared as `static`, builtin variables, free-floating functions and non-capturing
      lambdas have the global lifetime. Functions & builtin variables are initialized by the runtime before any user
      code runs, after that, global variables (variables declared as `static`) are initialized. Static initialization
      should follow the order in which the variables are declared. The declaration order guarantee states that if
      variable `a` was declared prior to variable `b`, it should be initialized before it. References that are
      default-initialized (or set to `null`) have static lifetime (since `null` has static lifetime).
    * Heap lifetime - Objects allocated on the heap via the use of the `new` operator followed by the object's type
      optional construction arguments or list initializer (ex: `new int32(6)`, `new int32[8]{1, 2, 3, 4}`).
* External lifetime - Variables whose storage duration is unknown, but are guaranteed to live longer than the current
  scope (for example, references passed as function arguments).
* Local lifetime - Variables declared as stack locals and class members have local lifetime. Objects that have local
  lifetime category are not allowed to exit their scope (for example, a reference that inherits the local lifetime of a
  class member may not be returned from that class), however they may enter any "child" scopes (such as being passed to
  a function as arguments).
    * Class lifetime - Variables declared as non-static members of a class.
    * Block lifetime -Variables declared within a function scope or an inner scope of a control statement (such an `if`
      statement).
